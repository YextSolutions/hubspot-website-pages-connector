# Product Description & Purpose

Pull in your Hubspot Website Pages with Yext's new Hubspot Data Connector! Hubspot CMS Hub integrates all your website tools in one place. With the addition of the Hubspot Website Pages, you can pull in all of your website pages into your Knowledge Graph to be used in Yext products. 

The Hubspot Website Pages Connector pulls in all the data you need about your Website Pages, such as name, url, updated date, published date, author name, and featured image into Yext. Note: The connector is configured to run comprehensively on a daily cadence. 

This app creates a custom Hubspot Website Pages entity type and 2 custom fields: 

- Author Name
- Featured Image
